#Play Angular Slick
---
Minimal project configuration featuring a Scala play blackend with Slick ORM and an Angular front end.

### Usage
* `sbt run`  
Builds the front end and run the backend. If a `node_modules` folder isn't found, it will also
run `npm install` before hand. Note also, that `sbt run` will run the angular compiler in watch mode. This is intended
for development mode.
* `sbt clean`  
Has a hook that will clean up the code generated by the front end compilation as well as remove the
`node_modules` folder.
* `sbt dist`  
This is for building for production mode. It builds the UI for production mode first
and will fail to build if an error is raised during the UI build.
